# Introduction 

>> Find a general way to describe something is so important in design algorithm. We need to **abstract and simplify** the input in objects that impact algorithms. Maybe The needed space of memory or the needed time (time complexity). In general all of us want faster path to finish tasks ignoring to some results to that path while the cost of resources is not hight and error rate can be handled . So the main topic is **TIME**. We find that the number of inputs that denoted by **n** is the most effective factor in the time  . the algorithm's operations may apply in every single item more that one time **(Iteration)**. That mean the time increase when **n** increase.


# Mathmatical's Description
>> Every system has factors that impact its performance. In our case, time is the primary factor in an algorithm's efficiency. We define Time Complexity as a function $T(n)$, which expresses the relationship between the execution time and the number of inputs $n$.This function $T(n)$ could be $n^2 + 3n$, $n \lg n$, or even $n^n + c$. These relations are defined by calculating the summation of operations performed at each step of the algorithm as a function of $n$.
