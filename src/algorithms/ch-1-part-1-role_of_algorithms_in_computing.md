* **Overview**
    Algorithms are not far from real life. Everything you do needs ordered steps to be accomplished. These steps might be complex or simple. To create something, you must know its cost, whether in materials or information. Understanding the status before starting helps you define what you actually want, the steps needed, and predict the results.

* **Definitions**
    - A computational procedure that takes a value or a set of values as **input** and produces a value or a set of values as **output** in a **finite** amount of time.
    - A sequence of steps that transforms the **current status** (input) into a **target status** (output).

* **The Importance of Studying Algorithms**
    Life changes according to rules, and every problem has a solution or a way to be handled. Studying algorithms builds a strong mentality to find the best or most appropriate solutions.

* **Notices**
    - Not all problems have efficient algorithms, such as **NP-complete** problems. In these cases, we aim for a "good enough" solution (Approximation) rather than a perfect one.
    - Usually, an efficient algorithm is defined by taking less **time** and **memory** to produce the output.
