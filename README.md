# Implement CLRS using Rust

This repository contains implementations of algorithms and concepts from the book **"Introduction to Algorithms" (4th Edition)** using the Rust programming language.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main modules:

* **[Algorithms](./src/algorithms)**: Contains the implementation of various algorithms. Each sub-module includes a `README.md` for definitions and theoretical notes.
* **[Data Structures](./src/data_structures)**: Contains the organizational structures used to manage data efficiently.
* **[Math](./src/math)**: A helper module focusing on mathematical theories and proofs related to the algorithms (e.g., summations, recurrences).
